ID,Question,Difficulty,A,B,C,D,Correct Answer
1,What is the main purpose of system modeling in software engineering?,Easy,To write executable code automatically,To replace system testing,To create abstract representations that help understand and communicate the system,To define hardware requirements only,C
2,What does a context model primarily show?,Medium,The internal algorithms of the system,The system boundaries and the external systems it interacts with,The sequence of method calls inside classes,The database schema of the system,B
3,Which UML diagram is best suited to show the order of interactions between actors and system components during a use case?,Medium,Class diagram,Activity diagram,State diagram,Sequence diagram,D
4,What is the main benefit of using generalization (inheritance) in class diagrams?,Hard,It improves system runtime performance,It removes the need for interfaces,It reduces complexity by allowing common attributes and operations to be shared,It guarantees that the system will be reusable,C
5,Which statement correctly describes architectural drift and architectural erosion?,Expert,Drift violates the prescriptive architecture,erosion does not,Both drift and erosion are planned architectural changes,Drift introduces changes not planned but not violating the architecture,C
6,What is the main goal of software reviews?,Easy,To estimate the project budget,To replace software testing,To detect errors and improve software quality,To measure developer productivity,C
7,Which of the following best describes a formal review?,Medium,An informal discussion between developers,A scheduled review conducted by senior participants to approve a product,A test executed after implementation,A customer acceptance meeting,B
8,What is the key difference between a walkthrough and an inspection?,Easy,Walkthroughs are performed after testing,inspections before testing,Walkthroughs focus on management issues,inspections on cost,C
9,Why are reviews considered more cost-effective when performed early in the software life cycle?,Expert,Early reviews eliminate the need for maintenance,Reviews replace unit and integration testing,The cost of defect removal increases significantly in later phases,Reviews prevent all defects from occurring,C
10,What is not considered a purpose of software reviews?,Easy,Detecting errors,Improving software quality,Approving a product to move to the next phase,Evaluating the project budget and schedule,D
11,What is one key limitation of software testing?,Easy,It guarantees the software has no defects,It can only show the presence of defects not their absence,It replaces the need for requirements,It works only after deployment,B
12,Which activity focuses on checking whether the system meets user needs?,Easy,Verification,Validation,Debugging,Refactoring,B
13,What is the main goal of software architecture?,Easy,Writing source code,Managing databases,Defining the system’s main structural design decisions,Performing unit tests,C
14,Which of the following is an advantage of software inspections over dynamic testing?,Medium,They require executing the program,They can detect performance issues,They can be applied before implementation,They replace system testing,C
15,What is the primary purpose of equivalence partitioning in black-box testing?,Medium,To test every possible input value,To reduce the number of test cases while maintaining coverage,To analyze internal code structure,To measure code complexity,B
16,What is written first in Test-Driven Development (TDD)?,Medium,Full system documentation,The production code,The test cases,The system architecture,C
17,What does cyclomatic complexity primarily indicate?,Hard,Program execution speed,Number of variables used,Number of independent execution paths,Memory consumption,C
18,Which situation best fits the use of a Layered Architecture?,Hard,When minimal latency is required,When components frequently bypass each other,When multiple teams develop different abstraction levels,When the system has only one user interface,C
19,Why is regression testing critical during software maintenance?,Hard,To add new features faster,To verify hardware compatibility,To ensure changes did not break existing functionality,To redesign the system architecture,C
20,Why is requirements-based testing considered effective?,Hard,It focuses on internal algorithms,It tests only user interface components,It directly links tests to documented requirements,It eliminates the need for system testing,C
