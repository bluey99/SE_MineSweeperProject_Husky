3,Which UML diagram is best suited to show the order of interactions between actors and system components during a use case?,Medium,Class diagram,Activity diagram,State diagram,Sequence diagram,D
4,What is the main benefit of using generalization (inheritance) in class diagrams?,Hard,It improves system runtime performance,It removes the need for interfaces,It reduces complexity by allowing common attributes and operations to be shared,It guarantees that the system will be reusable,C
5,Which statement correctly describes architectural drift and architectural erosion?,Expert,Drift violates the prescriptive architecture,erosion does not,Both drift and erosion are planned architectural changes,Drift introduces changes not planned but not violating the architecture,C
6,What is the main goal of software reviews?,Easy,To estimate the project budget,To replace software testing,To detect errors and improve software quality,To measure developer productivity,C
7,Which of the following best describes a formal review?,Medium,An informal discussion between developers,A scheduled review conducted by senior participants to approve a product,A test executed after implementation,A customer acceptance meeting,B
8,What is the key difference between a walkthrough and an inspection?,Easy,Walkthroughs are performed after testing,inspections before testing,Walkthroughs focus on management issues,inspections on cost,C
9,Why are reviews considered more cost-effective when performed early in the software life cycle?,Expert,Early reviews eliminate the need for maintenance,Reviews replace unit and integration testing,The cost of defect removal increases significantly in later phases,Reviews prevent all defects from occurring,C
10,What is not considered a purpose of software reviews?,Easy,Detecting errors,Improving software quality,Approving a product to move to the next phase,Evaluating the project budget and schedule,D
11,What is one key limitation of software testing?,Easy,It guarantees the software has no defects,It can only show the presence of defects not their absence,It replaces the need for requirements,It works only after deployment,B
12,Which activity focuses on checking whether the system meets user needs?,Easy,Verification,Validation,Debugging,Refactoring,B
13,What is the main goal of software architecture?,Easy,Writing source code,Managing databases,Defining the system’s main structural design decisions,Performing unit tests,C
14,Which of the following is an advantage of software inspections over dynamic testing?,Medium,They require executing the program,They can detect performance issues,They can be applied before implementation,They replace system testing,C
15,What is the primary purpose of equivalence partitioning in black-box testing?,Medium,To test every possible input value,To reduce the number of test cases while maintaining coverage,To analyze internal code structure,To measure code complexity,B
16,What is written first in Test-Driven Development (TDD)?,Medium,Full system documentation,The production code,The test cases,The system architecture,C
17,What does cyclomatic complexity primarily indicate?,Hard,Program execution speed,Number of variables used,Number of independent execution paths,Memory consumption,C
18,Which situation best fits the use of a Layered Architecture?,Hard,When minimal latency is required,When components frequently bypass each other,When multiple teams develop different abstraction levels,When the system has only one user interface,C
19,Why is regression testing critical during software maintenance?,Hard,To add new features faster,To verify hardware compatibility,To ensure changes did not break existing functionality,To redesign the system architecture,C
20,Why is requirements-based testing considered effective?,Hard,It focuses on internal algorithms,It tests only user interface components,It directly links tests to documented requirements,It eliminates the need for system testing,C
21,Which type of testing is performed on individual software units?,Easy,Unit testing,Acceptance testing,Integration testing,System testing,A
22,Why can testing not be considered sufficient to guarantee software correctness?,Hard,Because testing can reveal the presence of defects but cannot prove their absence,Because testing examines only selected execution paths and inputs,Both A and B are correct,None of the above,C
23,Which statement BEST explains why a layered architecture improves maintainability?,Hard,Layers eliminate dependencies between system components,Layers ensure that changes never propagate across the system,Layers guarantee simpler code and fewer defects,None of the above,D
24,Why is regression testing essential after modifying a software system?,Hard,To ensure new functionality meets user requirements,To verify that recent changes did not introduce unintended side effects,To revalidate system performance under stress,To confirm that the architecture remains unchanged,B
25,Which type of maintenance focuses on fixing discovered defects?,Easy,Corrective maintenance,Perfective maintenance,Adaptive maintenance,Preventive maintenance,A
26,Why is testing said to be part of both verification and validation?,Medium,Because tests are written before requirements,Because testing checks both conformance to specifications and user expectations,Because testing replaces inspections,Because testing is performed only after implementation,B
27,Which of the following is NOT a purpose of requirements engineering?,Medium,Understanding stakeholder needs,Defining system constraints,Designing the internal system architecture,Documenting system requirements,C
28,What is the main difference between verification and validation?,Expert,Verification checks performance and validation checks usability,"Verification asks ""Are we building the right product?"" and validation asks ""Are we building the product right?""",Verification checks conformance to specifications and validation checks customer needs,Verification is done after deployment and validation before,C
